Create a repository in current working directory:
git init
Creates an empty repository. You have to commit the files yourself

Status of a repository:
git status
Shows what files are not yet committed
Eg:
    On branch master
    
    Initial commit
    
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    
            lesson_1_reflections.txt
            lesson_2_reflections.txt
    
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


Add files to the staging area to be committed:
git add <file>

Remove files from the staging area:
git reset <file>

Before commit make sure you set a default text editor:
git config --global core.editor "C:/Program\ Files/Just\ Great\ Software/EditPad\ Lite\ 7/EditPadLite7.exe"
