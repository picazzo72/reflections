You can use
diff -u game_old.js game_new.js
to view differences between two files.
The lines from the old file which differ from the lines in the new file are marked with -
The new lines in the new file are marked with +
You also see 3 lines of context surrounding the changed lines which have not been changed.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to show the different revisions that were committed. Each revision has an id.
git diff is used with two different revision ids to see the differences.
Syntax coloring is turned on with
git config --global color.ui auto


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always go back to a previous version of the code which was not broken.
I checkout a previous revision with
git checkout df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53


Global settings:
git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
